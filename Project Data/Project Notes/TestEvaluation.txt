In our project we have three types of assesment 
1.Diagnostic
2.Formative
3.Summative

The evaluation of the same can be taken as follow.

*Suppose the test is composed of N concepts.
*The test contains 'n1' questions of concept N1,'n2' questions of concept N2.,'n3' questions of concept N3,'n4' questions of concept N4....
*Total number of students attempting the test is 'S'.

 The evaluation will be done for overall topic as well as for each sub-topic.
 
 So, for an Instance,

A test has Q questions.
Total number of sub-topics:N
n1 questions from topic N1
n2 questions from topic N2
n3 questions from topic N3
n4 questions from topic N4

suppose all test taker give X correct answers out of T total questions T= no. of students * no. of questions in the test
Correct answers for topic N1 = X1
Correct answers for topic N2 = X2
Correct answers for topic N3 = X3
Correct answers for topic N4 = X4

% of correct answers for a topic = 100*(total number of correct answers for that topic)/((number of questions for that topic)*(total number of students attempted the exam))

% of correct answer for overall topic = 100 * X/(Q*S)

% of correct answer for overall topic N1 = 100 * X1/(n1*S)

% of correct answer for overall topic N2 = 100 * X2/(n2*S)

% of correct answer for overall topic N3 = 100 * X3/(n3*S)

% of correct answer for overall topic N4 = 100 * X4/(n4*S)

LETS CONSIDER FOLLOWING EXAMPLE

Suppose there is a test on C
so,
Total number of questions = 20
Topic : C
   Sub-topic-1 : Data Types -5 questions
   Sub-topic-2 : Array      -5 questions
   Sub-topic-3 : Pointers   -5 questions
   Sub-topic-4 : Functions  -5 questions

There are total 25 students assigned for the test
But, only 22 students attempted the test,So we should ignore those 3 students during evaluation

Here,
Total number of questions will be = 20 * 22
                                  = 440 questions

Suppose
Total correct answer given by students = 300

% of correct answer given for overall test = 100*(total number of correct answer)/((number of questions for test)*(total number of students attempted the exam))

                                           = 100*300/440
% of correct answer given for overall test = 68.18%

Now,let calculate for individual sub-topic

Consider,sub-topic = Array
Total number of questions on Array will be = 5 * 22
                                  = 110 questions

Suppose
Total correct answer given by students = 50

% of correct answer given for Array topic = 100*(total number of correct answers for that topic)/((number of questions for that topic)*(total number of students attempted the exam))

                                           = 100*50/110
% of correct answer given for Array topic = 45.45%

So, teacher will know students are weak in Array cocepts to take further action
